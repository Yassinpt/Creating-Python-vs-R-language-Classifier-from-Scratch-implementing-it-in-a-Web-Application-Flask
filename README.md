# Creating-Python-vs-R-language-Classifier-from-Scratch-implementing-it-in-a-Web-Application-Flask-
This Project was realized in 3 steps : 
1) we had collected data ourselves using Web Scraping.
2) after had been doing the preprocessing for the data collected, we made a Python vs R language Classifier using Naive Bayes Model and Some functionalities of NLP(NLTK).
3) this Classifier was implemented in a Web Application Using Flask a micro web framework written in Python.

Note : when we tried to collect data from StackOverFlow , we have been rescpecting some rules like sending 30 requests per second(max) to StakOverFlow servers in order to avoid blocking our IP Adress by those servers.
