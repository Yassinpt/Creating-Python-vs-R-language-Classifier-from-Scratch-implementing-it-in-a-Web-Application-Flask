Example from data set : 
"I have a .csv file, and I need to do what follows: for each line, starting from the end of the line, the text that occurs after a certain number of occurrences of a specified character should be enclosed in quotation marks.I'll try and make myself clearer with an example. Consider the following line of a csv:I want to enclose in quotation marks the slice of the line which occurs, starting from the end, after the fourth occurrence of a comma. So, it should become:I'd like to do it in bash, pure python, or pandas.",python
